GROMACS: This workflow outlines the essential commands and processes involved in performing molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS, focusing on energy minimization, equilibration, and production runs.

QED: Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness (QED) is a metric that helps evaluate the "drug-likeness" of small molecules based on a combination of molecular properties. It integrates several attributes such as molecular weight, lipophilicity (logP), polar surface area (PSA), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, number of rotatable bonds, and number of aromatic rings. This codes will give you the QED value for the molecule represented by the given SMILES string. If you want to calculate QED values for multiple molecules in a CSV file, you can read the file, extract the SMILES column, and apply the QED calculation to each molecule.
